# Project 03 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Successfully created a professional scope statement that clearly defined project goals, boundaries, and deliverables.
- Built a functional two-page website prototype using **semantic HTML** and **basic CSS**.
- Organized all project files in a **GitHub repository** with proper folder structure.
- Applied project management principles (planning, WBS, risk analysis) effectively.

## What Went Wrong
- Initial CSS styling took longer than expected due to alignment and layout adjustments.
- Minor link issues occurred during initial testing between pages.
- Time management could have been improved to allow more testing before final deployment.

## What I Would Do Differently
- Begin testing HTML and CSS earlier in the project to avoid last-minute fixes.
- Create a small checklist for file organization before starting coding.
- Allocate more time for reflection and polish to enhance presentation.

## Key Takeaways
- Integrating **project management planning** with **technical execution** helps maintain structure and clarity.
- Even simple website projects benefit from clear documentation and planning.
- Using GitHub effectively provides a professional portfolio-ready result.
